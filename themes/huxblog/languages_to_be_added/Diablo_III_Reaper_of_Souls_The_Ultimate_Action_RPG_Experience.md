In Reaper of Souls, you will face the angel of death Malthael, who has returned to Sanctuary with a dark and sinister plan. He intends to use the Black Soulstone, which contains the essence of the Prime Evil Diablo, to wipe out all of humanity. As one of the Nephalem, the legendary heroes who defeated Diablo in the previous game, you must stop Malthael and his army of reapers before they unleash a new age of darkness upon the world.
 
You can choose from six different classes to play as: Barbarian, Crusader, Demon Hunter, Monk, Witch Doctor, or Wizard. Each class has its own unique skills, abilities, and playstyle. You can customize your character with various items, weapons, armor, gems, and runes. You can also level up your character and unlock new skills and passive abilities as you progress through the game.

You can complete bounties, which are random quests that reward you with gold and loot. You can also enter Nephalem Rifts, which are randomly generated dungeons that offer greater challenges and rewards. You can also participate in Seasons, which are limited-time events that let you start a new character and compete with other players on leaderboards.

However, some players may encounter problems when trying to run the game on modern operating systems such as Windows 7, 8, or 10. The most common issue is an installation error that says "Module 50279" and prevents the game from launching. This is caused by an incompatible executable file that does not work on 64-bit systems.
 
Fortunately, there are some solutions that can help you fix this problem and enjoy the game on your PC. Here are some steps you can follow:
 
1. Download the [XXL1Patcher](https://www.speedrun.com/aoxxl/resources) from speedrun.com [^1^]. This is a tool that modifies the game's executable file to make it compatible with 64-bit systems. It also fixes some other issues such as the ending cutscene crash and the missing "Greece" text on the level map.
2. Extract the contents of xxl1patcher.zip and go into the game's folder. Drag the file "GameModule.elb" onto the "xxl1patcher.exe". A window should notify you about the success or failure of the patching process.
3. If you want to improve the game's graphics and performance, you can also download the [Quality of Life Patch](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Asterix_%26_Obelix_XXL#Essential_improvements) from PCGamingWiki [^2^]. This patch adds features such as widescreen resolutions, windowed mode, horizontal FOV, infinite potion cheat, camera rightstick fix, and more. To install it, copy the d3d9.dll and xxl\_qol\_settings.ini files to the main game folder. You can edit the settings values in the ini file using notepad.
4. If you want to use V-sync to prevent screen tearing, you can rename GameModule.elb to axxl.exe and force V-sync using your graphics card's control panel or a third-party tool such as [NVIDIA GeForce Experience](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/) or [AMD Radeon Software](https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/radeon-software).
5. Launch the game and enjoy!
